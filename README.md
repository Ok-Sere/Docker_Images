# Docker Images

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the essential steps for working with Docker images, including pulling images, creating files, building images, tagging, pushing, and pulling images from a repository. It also covers configuring Docker, managing inbound rules, and verifying outputs. The guide is designed to help users understand the Docker workflow and its practical applications.

## Step 1: Pulling a Docker Image
To begin, pull the desired Docker image from a repository. This is the first step in setting up your Docker environment.

## Step 2: Verifying the Pulled Image
After pulling the image, verify its presence in your local Docker environment.

## Step 3: Editing Files with Nano
Use a text editor like Nano to create or edit files required for your Docker container.

## Step 4: Creating a File
Create the necessary files for your Docker container. These files may include configuration files, Dockerfiles, or application code.

---

## Step 5: Building a Docker Image
Build a Docker image using the `docker build` command. This step packages your application and its dependencies into a single image.

## Step 6: Configuring Inbound Rules
Set up inbound rules to allow traffic to your Docker container. This is essential for enabling external access to your application.

## Step 7: Verifying Output
Run your Docker container and verify the output to ensure everything is working as expected.

---

## Step 8: Starting Docker
Start Docker to initialize your container and begin running your application.

---

## Step 9: Accessing the Application
Access your application through the specified port (e.g., 8080) to confirm it is running correctly.

## Step 10: Logging into Docker Hub
Log in to Docker Hub to prepare for pushing your image to a repository.

## Step 11: Tagging the Docker Image
Tag your Docker image with a meaningful name and version to make it easier to identify in the repository.

---

## Step 12: Pushing the Docker Image
Push your Docker image to a repository, such as Docker Hub, to make it available for others to use.

---

## Step 13: Pulling the Docker Image
Finally, pull the Docker image from the repository to verify it was successfully uploaded and is accessible.

## Summary
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of working with Docker images, from pulling and building images to pushing and pulling them from a repository. By following these steps, you can efficiently manage Docker images and containers, enabling seamless application deployment and scaling. Docker simplifies the process of packaging and distributing applications, making it an essential tool for modern software development.
